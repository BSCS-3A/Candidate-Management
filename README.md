# Candidate-Management
V1.3 Has an almost fully-functional sidebar for position management (adding, editing, and deleting positions). Candidate datatable for the respective positions is still a WIP, but it will be generated as an onclick function of "view" button.

Current problems
1.) Current iteration of datatable generation is purely run on linked scripts and stylesheets which make editing and customizing datatable a bit problematic, still trying to find a simpler or better approach to it.
