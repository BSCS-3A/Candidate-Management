# Candidate-Management
HTML is still kinda clunky, trying to complete all the elements so I can cut down on all the bootstrap styling .

Current problems
1.) Admin Dashboard bootstrap css bleeds into Candidate Information Management css (still fixing)
2.) Deciding whether the sidenav should still be included since the data table can pretty much load all candidate data and present it
3.) Search and Pagination elements of the data table still not added
